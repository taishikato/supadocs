description: Spin up Supadocs locally and connect the core services
---

Supadocs combines a Next.js frontend with Supabase pgvector so that every documentation site ships with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later
- pnpm 10 or later
- Supabase CLI and Docker running in the background
- Access to an OpenAI-compatible API key for embeddings and chat

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Create `.env.local` from the template and populate the Supabase and model credentials.
3. Start Supabase locally and apply migrations:
   ```bash
   supabase start
   supabase migration up
   ```
4. Launch the monorepo dev servers:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

The Next.js app runs on `http://localhost:3000` and renders Markdown/MDX files from `apps/web/content/docs`.

## Next Steps

- Learn how chat responses are composed in [Chat Pipeline](/docs/chat).
- Review the data flow from GitHub Actions to pgvector in [Reindex Architecture](/docs/reindex-architecture).
- Explore the product guardrails and audit events described in [Agent Runtime Preview](/docs/agent-runtime-preview).
