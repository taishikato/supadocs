title: Deep Nesting Example
description: Demonstrates how Supadocs renders and routes deeply nested documentation pages.
---

This page hangs out at `content/docs/nesting/deep-nesting-example.mdx` so we can show how Supadocs handles multi-level slugs without breaking a sweat.

## Why this path matters

- Gives us a quick way to watch the catch-all route `app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` do its thing.
- Lets us double-check that the sidebar and breadcrumb trail stay accurate as we go deeper.
- Offers a roomy sandbox for poking at long-path link issues before anything ships.

## Suggested verification steps

1. Swing by `/docs/nesting/deep-nesting-example` in the preview build.
2. Make sure the breadcrumb trail calls out every parent segment like youâ€™d expect.
3. Kick off the Collector agent and confirm it logs this page with the full nested slug.

> Keep this page handy as a friendly canary whenever you tweak routing or the crawler.
