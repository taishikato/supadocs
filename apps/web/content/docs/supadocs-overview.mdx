# Supadocs Overview

Supadocs is an AI-enabled documentation template that combines Next.js, Supabase, and a pnpm/TurboRepo monorepo. The goal is simple: ship project docs that already include Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) search and chat so teams can deliver helpful answers from day one.

## Why Supadocs

- Ship an opinionated docs-as-code workflow that renders Markdown/MDX through the `apps/web` Next.js app.
- Keep semantic search fresh using Supabase pgvector and incremental embedding updates.
- Offer a streaming chat experience powered by the Vercel AI SDK and OpenAI-compatible models.
- Share UI components, utilities, and future agent runtimes across projects via `packages/*`.
- Automate reindexing after every merge by triggering a Supabase Edge Function from GitHub Actions.

## Monorepo Structure

```text
apps/
  web/                 # Next.js App Router UI and API routes
packages/
  core/                # Shared chunking and embedding helpers
  ui/                  # shadcn/ui based component library
  eslint-config/       # Unified linting rules
  typescript-config/   # Base tsconfig consumed by apps and packages
supabase/
  functions/reindex/   # Edge Function for embeddings upsert
  migrations/          # pgvector schema and helpers
llm/                   # Product docs, PRDs, and planning notes
```

This layout enables shared tooling, clean boundaries, and future expansion into dedicated agent packages described in the roadmap.

## Core Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- pnpm 10 or newer
- Supabase CLI with Docker for local development
- Access to an OpenAI-compatible API for embeddings and chat

## Local Setup At A Glance

1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and provide Supabase credentials plus model configuration.
3. Run `supabase start` followed by `supabase migration up` to initialize the local database.
4. Launch the monorepo dev servers via `pnpm dev` and open `http://localhost:3000`.

Markdown and MDX content stored in `apps/web/content/docs` hot-reloads automatically, keeping the authoring workflow fast and approachable.

## Supabase Edge Function

The `reindex` Edge Function processes GitHub webhook payloads and keeps pgvector embeddings synchronized. Deploy it with `supabase functions deploy reindex`, set the required secrets (`EDGE_FUNCTION_REINDEX_SECRET`, `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `EMBEDDING_MODEL`), and mirror those values in `.github/workflows/reindex.yml`.

## Development Scripts

- `pnpm dev` — Run the Next.js app and watch builds.
- `pnpm build` — Execute `turbo build` across all workspaces.
- `pnpm lint` — Apply the shared ESLint preset everywhere.
- `pnpm format` — Format TypeScript, MDX, and Markdown via Prettier.

## Looking Ahead

Agent runtimes, tooling abstractions, and Supabase schema automation will land in upcoming packages:

- `packages/agents-core` for task orchestration primitives.
- `packages/agents-tools` for reusable provider wrappers.
- `scripts/` for Supabase schema synchronization and operational CLIs.

Refer to `llm/prd.md` and `AGENTS.md` whenever you need the latest product direction and implementation details.
