title: Agent Runtime Preview
description: Upcoming collector, composer, and reviewer agents roadmap
---

Supadocs is evolving into an agent-driven platform where documentation tasks can be scheduled, audited, and replayed.

## Agent Taxonomy

- **Collector Agent** crawls the `content/` directory, extracts metadata, and refreshes embeddings.
- **Composer Agent** turns collected context into release notes, FAQs, and changelog drafts.
- **Reviewer Agent** validates tone, factual accuracy, and links before publishing suggestions.
- **Router Agent** (optional) monitors confidence scores to trigger retries or escalate to human review.

Each agent emits a correlation ID so executions can be traced across logs and Supabase tables.

## Runtime Building Blocks

1. `packages/agents-core` will expose `registerAgent`, `runTask`, and a lightweight in-memory queue.
2. `packages/agents-tools` provides provider-agnostic wrappers for language models, embeddings, and search utilities.
3. Telemetry and audit trails are stored in Supabase tables such as `agent_runs`, `agent_events`, and `agent_artifacts`.

These modules keep the pipeline privacy-first by using `.env` secrets and disallowing calls to unapproved vendors.

## Roadmap Checklist

- Bootstrap the runtime scaffolding and type contracts with Vitest coverage.
- Integrate schema sync scripts under `scripts/` to keep Supabase migrations reproducible.
- Ship the Collector Agent as the MVP with idempotent runs and replayable timelines.
